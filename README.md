Below is a plain-text README.md file you can copy directly. It covers installation, usage, deployment, and custom domain instructions for your Streamlit app. Just copy the following content verbatim into your README.md file:

# Model Evaluation & Comparison Suite - Streamlit App

## Overview
This repository contains a Streamlit application that allows data scientists to upload machine learning model files (pickle or joblib), along with a test dataset (CSV), and then automatically evaluate and compare the models. The app computes key metrics, performs subgroup analysis, and generates interactive visualizations. Additionally, users can generate a downloadable HTML report of the evaluation results.

## Features
- **Model Loading:** Upload and compare multiple models at once.
- **Data Validation:** Automatically validates the test dataset and target column.
- **Metric Computation:**
  - For Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.
  - For Regression: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ².
- **Subgroup Analysis:** Automatically bins numeric features with many unique values, or analyzes user-specified subgroups.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Utilizes Plotly for futuristic, interactive charts including bar charts, heatmaps (confusion matrices), ROC curves, and residual plots.
- **Downloadable Report:** Generate and download a comprehensive HTML report that includes tables and interactive charts.
- **Custom Domain Deployment:** Instructions provided for embedding the app in a GitHub Pages site and linking it to your custom domain.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/model-eval-suite.git
   cd model-eval-suite
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed, then run:
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Run the App Locally:**
   Launch the Streamlit app by running:
   ```
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## Usage
- **Upload Files:** Use the sidebar to upload one or more model files (in .pkl or .joblib format) and a CSV test dataset.
- **Configuration:** Choose the task type (classification or regression), specify the target column name, and optionally enter subgroup features (comma-separated).
- **Evaluation:** Click "Run Evaluation" to compute metrics, generate visualizations, and view a comparison summary.
- **Download Report:** If desired, check the option to generate a downloadable HTML report of the results.

## Deployment & Custom Domain
This app can be deployed on Streamlit Cloud. For custom domain deployment:
1. Deploy your app on Streamlit Cloud to get a public URL.
2. Create a GitHub Pages repository with an `index.html` file that embeds your Streamlit app via an iframe.
3. Link your GitHub Pages site to your custom domain by configuring the repository settings and updating your DNS records.
For example, your `index.html` could contain:
   ```
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8" />
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
     <title>My Model Evaluation App</title>
     <style>
       body { margin: 0; padding: 0; overflow: hidden; }
       iframe { border: none; width: 100vw; height: 100vh; }
     </style>
   </head>
   <body>
     <iframe src="https://share.streamlit.io/yourusername/model-eval-suite/streamlit_app.py"></iframe>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
4. Follow GitHub Pages documentation to configure your custom domain.

## Testing
Unit tests are provided in the `tests/` directory. To run tests:
```
pytest
```
